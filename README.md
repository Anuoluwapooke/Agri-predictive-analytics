## Project Overview

This repository demonstrates end-to-end predictive analytics on agricultural data, focusing on crop yield prediction based on rainfall and engineered risk features. The projects include:

- Data cleaning and handling missing values  
- Feature engineering (Low Rainfall and Low Yield risk flags)  
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) and correlation visualization  
- Predictive modeling using Linear Regression  
- Evaluation and visualization of model predictions

These projects provide actionable insights to support farmers and AgriTech stakeholders in making informed decisions.
