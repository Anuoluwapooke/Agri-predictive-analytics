# Predictive Analysis of Rainfall Impact on Crop Yield (AgriTech)

## Overview
This project analyzes how rainfall influences crop yield using exploratory
data analysis and visualizations. The objective is to identify low-rainfall
risk periods and provide data-driven recommendations to support agricultural
planning and supply chain stability.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- pandas
- matplotlib
- Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook

## Key Insights
- Crop yields are higher during seasons with above-average rainfall
- Low-rainfall seasons are associated with increased yield risk
- Rainfall and crop yield show a positive correlation

## Prediction & Recommendation
If rainfall falls below the historical average, crop yields are expected to
decline. Farmers should implement drip irrigation strategies to mitigate
production risk and maintain stable agricultural output.
